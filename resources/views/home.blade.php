            I've been building software since early 2012, with the bulk of my experience being on the web platform. I'm
            currently building tools to empower interior designers, both big at small, at
            <a href="https://onsidedoor.com">SideDoor</a>.</p>

        <p>Before SideDoor, I co-hosted the <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/does-not-compute">Does Not Compute</a> Podcast, built (the
            now-defunct)
            <a href="https://designkollective.com">Design Kollective</a>, and was an Engineering Lead at
            <a href="https://metalab.com">MetaLab</a>.</p>
